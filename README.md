# DONOT USE THE PYTHON SCRIPT ON WEB SERVERS OR WEBSITES YOU DO NOT OWN
# DDoS Attack Simulation for Business Use
# Project Overview
This project focuses on simulating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to analyze their impact on business-critical web applications. The primary objective is to understand the techniques employed in DDoS attacks, their effects on system performance, and the potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited. The project is designed for research and educational purposes, particularly for studying the offensive side of cybersecurity.

### Key Features
DDoS Attack Simulation: Implementation of various DDoS attack techniques to test the resilience of web applications.
Traffic Analysis: Monitoring and analyzing network traffic during attacks to evaluate the impact on bandwidth, latency, and server availability.
Custom Attack Scenarios: Simulating attacks with configurable parameters such as request rate, target endpoints, and payload size.
Performance Metrics: Logging and visualizing key performance indicators like response times, throughput, and server downtime.
Project Scope
The project is not intended for malicious use. Instead, it serves as a resource for understanding the mechanics of DDoS attacks, which can ultimately guide the development of better defensive mechanisms.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Networking Libraries: Scapy, Socket, or other tools for generating traffic
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, and Seaborn for traffic analysis
Testing Environment: Local/Virtual test server
